Smart Home Environmental Monitoring System 
Descriptions  
Design a Smart Home Security and Environment Monitoring System that tracks various environmental 
parameters (temperature, humidity, motion, and gas detection) and provides security alerts. This system 
will use ESP32-S3 DevKits, which will multitask to handle various sensors, connect to Wi-Fi, and send 
data to an online server. The system will also include real-time alerts for unauthorized entry or 
hazardous gas levels, allowing users to remotely monitor and control their home environment and 
security. 
Project Objectives: 
1. Environmental Monitoring: Measure temperature, humidity, and gas levels within a home. 
2. Security Monitoring: Detect motion and unauthorized entry using PIR sensors. 
3. Multitasking: Implement multitasking on the ESP32 to handle multiple sensors and processes 
simultaneously. 
4. Wi-Fi Connectivity: Use the ESP32â€™s Wi-Fi capabilities to connect to the home network and 
communicate with an online server. 
5. Data Logging and Visualization: Store sensor data on a cloud server and provide real-time 
visualization through a web or mobile interface. 
6. Real-Time Alerts: Send alerts for security breaches or hazardous conditions (e.g., smoke, gas 
leaks).
